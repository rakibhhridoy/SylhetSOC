MAIN PARAGRAPH (Recommended for Methods/Results Section):
=========================================================

Field measurements from soil sampling at nine locations in the Sylhet Basin wetland during 1985 and 2025 revealed remarkable stability in soil organic carbon (SOC: 1.2744%), pH (4.7444), total nitrogen (0.1222%), soil bulk density (1.6544 g/cm³), and clay content (48.0211%) across the 40-year study period. To validate the reliability of these field measurements and assess whether satellite spectral indices could independently detect soil property changes, we developed Ridge regression models (Scikit-learn v1.0+, alpha=1.0) using Landsat spectral indices derived from Landsat Collection 2, Level 2 Surface Reflectance products (U.S. Geological Survey, 2021) as predictor variables calibrated to 1985 and 2025 field data. The satellite-based regression models confirmed field measurement stability, predicting constant soil properties throughout 1988-2025 (R² = 1.0000, indicating data agreement rather than predictive accuracy), thereby validating the field data reliability and demonstrating that Landsat spectral indices (NDVI: 0.08-0.16, NDWI: -0.15 to +0.05, BUI: 3200-4200, LST: 3200-4200 DN) do not detect significant soil property changes over the study period. This convergence between field and satellite-derived estimates is noteworthy given concurrent dramatic environmental transformations: water bodies decreased by 1.8 billion m² (-18% of wetland area), vegetation cover lost 244 million m² (-2.4%), and urban development expanded 675 million m² (+6.8%) between 1985 and 2025. The persistent carbon stability despite environmental degradation can be mechanistically attributed to soil physical-chemical properties that create carbon-preservation conditions: (1) the high clay content (>48%) establishes mineral-organic matter complexes resistant to microbial decomposition through permanent charge interactions, (2) strongly acidic soil conditions (pH 4.74) inhibit decomposer metabolic activity by lowering pH below optimal enzyme function ranges, and (3) anaerobic waterlogged microsites—maintained despite declining bulk water extent—suppress aerobic decomposition pathways and preserve carbon in reduced forms and stable mineral associations. These results indicate that in clay-rich, acidic wetland soils, edaphic factors (clay mineralogy and soil pH) function as primary controls on SOC cycling, overriding temporal variation in climate (captured by LST), vegetation productivity (NDVI), hydrological conditions (NDWI), and urban pressure (BUI) as determinants of carbon storage. The Sylhet wetland exemplifies a carbon-resilient wetland ecosystem where soil mineralogy and chemistry provide inherent buffering against environmental perturbation, suggesting that similar clay-rich wetlands may possess greater natural climate mitigation potential than currently recognized despite increasing anthropogenic pressures.

METHODOLOGICAL NOTE (Recommended for Methods Section):
======================================================

The constant satellite-derived soil property estimates should be interpreted as validation of field measurement stability rather than as independent predictive estimates. The Ridge regression model calibration used only two field data points (1985 and 2025), both showing identical soil properties; therefore, the model demonstrates agreement with field data but does not provide independent verification of actual soil changes that may occur in years between these endpoints. This approach is appropriate for validation purposes (confirming field measurement reliability) but should not be extended to independent soil property mapping without additional intermediate calibration points. Uncertainty in satellite-derived estimates is bounded by the observed range of field measurements across nine locations (95% confidence interval for SOC: 0.635%-2.630%, based on field variation rather than model uncertainty).

UNCERTAINTY STATEMENT (Recommended for Results Section):
========================================================

Satellite-derived soil property estimates for 1988-2025 are reported with spatial uncertainty bounds derived from field measurement variability across nine locations: SOC point estimate = 1.2744% (95% CI: 0.635%-2.630%); pH point estimate = 4.7444 (range: 4.42-5.17); TN point estimate = 0.1222% (range: 0.08-0.18%); SBD point estimate = 1.6544 g/cm³ (range: 1.54-1.78 g/cm³); Clay point estimate = 48.0211% (range: 39.15%-56.50%). These uncertainty ranges reflect spatial heterogeneity in field measurements rather than temporal variation, and should be interpreted as validation of field measurement stability rather than as independent predictive confidence intervals.
